(This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn’t destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability.

This includes creatures that come under that player’s control after the ability has resolved and creatures that have lost all abilities.£6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura’s first ability causes creatures to attack him if able. If, during the affected player’s declare attackers step, a creature they control is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t attack, or is affected by “summoning sickness,” then that creature doesn’t attack. If there’s a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn’t forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn’t have to attack in that case either.£6/15/2010 : If a creature controlled by the affected player can’t attack Gideon Jura (because he’s no longer on the battlefield, for example), that player may have it attack you, another one of your planeswalkers, or nothing at all.£6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura’s first ability applies during each combat phase of the affected player’s next turn (as opposed to applying during the affected player’s next combat phase). The distinction is relevant if there are no combat phases during that turn (due to Fatespinner’s effect, for example) or there are multiples (due to World at War, for example).£6/15/2010 : If Gideon Jura becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn’t count as having a creature enter the battlefield.

Note that summoning sickness cares about when Gideon Jura came under your control, not when he became a creature.£6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura’s third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).£6/15/2010 : If you activate Gideon Jura’s third ability and then unpreventable damage is dealt to him (due to Unstable Footing, for example), that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon Jura (since he’s a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he’s a planeswalker). If the total amount of damage marked on Gideon Jura is lethal damage, he’s destroyed as a state-based action. If Gideon Jura has no loyalty counters on him, he’s put into his owner’s graveyard as a state-based action.£6/15/2010 : Say you activate Gideon Jura’s third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon Jura (since he’s still a planeswalker). Then Gideon Jura may block (since he’s a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that’s attacking him! During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he’s blocking, but he doesn’t deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.£1/22/2011 : The first ability only affects the declaration of attackers.

Although Nyxathid momentarily had 0 toughness while that spell was resolving, it isn’t put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action because state-based actions aren’t checked until the spell has finished resolving.','B',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('445974','Okaun, Eye of Chaos','BBD','Legendary Creature — Cyclops Berserker','R','5','3','3','Partner with Zndrsplt, Eye of Wisdom #_(When this creature enters the battlefield, target player may put Zndrsplt into their hand from their library, then shuffle.)_#£At the beginning of combat on your turn, flip a coin until you lose a flip.£Whenever a player wins a coin flip, double Okaun''s power and toughness until end of turn.','',NULL,'Yongjae Choi','£6/8/2018 : If an effect has a player flip a coin but refers to whether the flip came up heads or tails, that flip has no winner or loser.£6/8/2018 : If an effect instructs you to “double” a creature’s power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power.

A different mode can’t be chosen.£6/8/2018 : If the spell or ability that’s copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast or activated (like Blaze does), the copy will have the same value of X.£6/8/2018 : If the spell or ability has damage divided as it was cast or activated (like Chandra’s Pyrohelix), the division can’t be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).£6/8/2018 : The controller of a copied spell can’t choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Similarly, for Rowan’s emblem, effects based on non-mana costs that were paid for the original ability are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.£6/8/2018 : The last abilities of Will and Rowan apply to Commander games only. They have no effect in other games.£6/8/2018 : “Partner with [name]” represents two abilities.

If a legendary creature card with “partner with [name]” is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander. For more information on the Commander variant, please visit Wizards.com/Commander.£6/8/2018 : If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders’ combined color identities. If Khorvath and Sylvia are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with red and/or white in their color identity, but not blue, black, or green.£6/8/2018 : Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.£6/8/2018 : To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability (featured in the Magic: The Gathering—Commander™ (2016 Edition) set) or corresponding “partner with” abilities as the game begins. A creature with a “partner with” ability can’t partner with any creature other than its designated partner. Losing a partner ability during the game doesn’t cause either to cease to be your commander.£6/8/2018 : Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won’t have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined.

The prevention shield will apply to the next X damage that would be dealt to the first target, no matter where that damage comes from.

If it prevents damage, Acolyte’s Reward (not the source of that damage) deals damage to the second target as part of that prevention effect.

The new damage isn’t combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.£2/1/2014 : As Acolyte’s Reward tries to resolve, if only the first target is illegal, Acolyte’s Reward won’t prevent any damage that would be dealt to that creature and, because of this, Acolyte’s Reward won’t deal damage to the second target. If only the second target is illegal, damage that would be dealt to the first target will be prevented, but Acolyte’s Reward won’t deal damage. If both targets are illegal, Acolyte’s Reward won’t resolve.£2/1/2014 : After Acolyte’s Reward resolves, it no longer matters whether either target is still legal. For example, if the second target is a creature controlled by an opponent, and it gains hexproof after Acolyte’s Reward resolves but before it prevents damage, Acolyte’s Reward will still deal damage to that creature. If Acolyte’s Reward can’t deal damage to the second target (perhaps because it’s a creature that has left the battlefield), Acolyte’s Reward will still prevent damage; it just won’t deal any damage itself.£2/1/2014 : If Acolyte’s Reward prevents damage, it deals its damage immediately afterward as part of that same prevention effect. This happens before state-based actions are performed, and before any player can cast spells or activate abilities. If the source of the original damage was a spell or ability, this happens before that spell or ability resumes its resolution.£2/1/2014 : If the amount of damage that would be dealt to the first target is in excess of the amount of damage that Acolyte’s Reward would prevent, the source deals its excess damage to the first target at the same time that the rest of it is prevented. Then Acolyte’s Reward deals its damage.£2/1/2014 : The damage will be dealt by Acolyte’s Reward as it existed on the stack, not as it exists when the damage is dealt. That is, it’s an instant spell that’s dealing the damage, in case an ability cares about that (such as Satyr Firedancer’s, which includes the phrase “Whenever an instant or sorcery spell you control deals damage to an opponent”).£2/1/2014 : If the first target would be dealt combat damage by multiple creatures, you choose which of that damage to prevent.
